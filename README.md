**Calculator Project Report**

**Overview:**
The provided code presents a basic calculator capable of evaluating arithmetic expressions. It supports fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with functionalities like exponentiation, square root, rounding, and absolute value. Additionally, the calculator accommodates parentheses to establish the order of operations.

1. **Data Structures:**
   - The code employs two stacks: one for numbers and the other for operators. Stacks are utilized due to their suitability for handling expressions in the correct order.

2. **Functionality:**
   - The calculator provides support for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), exponentiation (^), and additional functions (exp, sqrt, round, abs).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Error handling is implemented to address situations such as division by zero and invalid expressions. The program provides informative error messages to guide users.

**Challenges Encountered:**

1. **Order of Operations:**
   - Implementing the correct order of operations, especially with parentheses, posed a challenge that demanded meticulous handling to ensure accurate expression evaluation.

2. **Function Implementation:**
   - Integrating additional functions into the evaluation logic, such as exponentiation, square root, rounding, and absolute value, required a clear understanding of their mathematical definitions and seamless integration into the codebase.

In summary, the calculator project demonstrates the implementation of a functional arithmetic expression evaluator using stacks.
